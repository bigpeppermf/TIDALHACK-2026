Redesign the full frontend for Monogram — a Vue 3 + TypeScript web app that converts handwritten notes into LaTeX using AI. The app uses Tailwind CSS v4, shadcn/vue primitives, and Clerk for authentication. Keep the same dark-first, purple-accented design language but make everything look more polished, modern, and cohesive. Here's every page and component:

Design System
Theme: Dark mode only (pure black #000 background, near-white #f2f2f2 text)
Brand Color: Purple hsl(270 60% 55%) — used for buttons, links, focus rings, accents
Surface colors: Cards are hsl(0 0% 4%), borders are hsl(270 4% 16%), muted text is hsl(270 5% 55%)
Fonts: Body = 'Domine' (serif), Display/Logo = 'Rubik Marker Hatch' (handwriting style), Mono = system monospace
Background pattern: Subtle dot grid (radial-gradient dots at 24px spacing)
Border radius: 10px default
Icons: Lucide icon library
Animations: Spring physics (motion-v), scroll-triggered fade-ups, hover glows
Page 1: Landing / Home Page (/)
A single-page marketing site with these sections:

Hero Section
Animated brand intro: the word "monogram" appears with a handwriting stroke animation (SVG text with stroke-dasharray), then a purple selection overlay sweeps across it, then the text splits into "mono" + "gram" and falls into place with spring physics, then a mouse-reactive purple text-shadow glow follows the cursor
Two CTA buttons: "Start Converting" (solid purple, links to /convert) + "See How It Works" (outlined, scrolls to #how-it-works)
Stats bar below CTAs: "99% Accuracy" · "<3s Conversion" · "10k+ Equations" in a 3-column row
Features Grid
6 feature cards in a bento grid layout (3 columns on desktop, 1 on mobile, some cards span 2-3 cols):
Drag & Drop Upload (upload icon)
AI-Powered OCR (lightning icon)
Clean LaTeX Output (code brackets icon)
Live Preview (eye icon)
Export Options (download icon)
Edit & Refine (clipboard icon)
Each card: dark card background, purple border glow on hover, gradient overlay on hover, scroll-triggered fade-up animation
How It Works
3-step vertical timeline with a gradient connector line on the left:
Upload Your Notes (image upload icon)
AI Processes It (code/processing icon)
Edit & Export (download icon)
Each step has a numbered circle, title, and description, with scroll-triggered slide-in animations
Page 2: Convert Page (/convert)

Generate complete, production-ready code for each page/component using Vue 3 <script setup lang="ts">, Tailwind CSS v4, and shadcn/vue primitives. Keep the same dark purple aesthetic but make the UI feel premium, clean, and highly polished. Focus on smooth micro-interactions, consistent spacing, refined typography hierarchy, and a cohesive visual system across all pages.
